# Simply Weather

## Summary:

The IP address is retrieved from the user to find their current location. Then the weather API uses the zipcode to gather data on the current weather in that location. Users can search for weather in a different city by zipcode or city name. Finally, a 5 day forecast is offered showing a brief snapshot (temperature and conditions) of these days.
